# Reactome Pengine

Reactome Pengine is a Prolog based API to the human reactome. It is available at https://apps.nms.kcl.ac.uk/reactome-pengine/.  Users can send their own small Prolog programs alongside a query to Reactome Pengine, so that the computation takes place in the cloud. Users send their 'Small' program to the 'Large' data, rather than the other way round, saving both bandwidth and storage space.
